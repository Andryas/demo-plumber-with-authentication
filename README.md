# About API

These are HTTP methods typically used in web development for making requests to a server:

    @get: This method is used to retrieve data from the server. It is commonly used for fetching information or resources from a specified URI.

    @post: This method is used to send data to the server to create a new resource. It is commonly used for submitting forms or sending data that needs to be processed and stored on the server.

    @put: This method is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. It differs from @post in that it is idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.

    @delete: This method is used to delete a resource from the server. It is commonly used to remove data or resources that are no longer needed.

    @head: This method is similar to @get, but it only retrieves the headers of the response without the body. It is often used to check the headers of a resource without actually downloading the entire resource, which can be useful for determining things like the content type or length of a resource.
